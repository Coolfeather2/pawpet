- disable peripheral
- set clock source to unused disabled clock
- say GCLK_CLKCTRL_GEN_GCLK7?

Power save notes:

disable:
sercom 0
sercom 1
sercom 3
sercom 5
- all of these are unused

DAC
- unused

all TC excluding TC5?
- unused

remapped gclk6 to gclk2 
disable glck3 and disregistered clock source







input pullup unused ports?

 was able to achieve a quiescent draw of 86.2 uA after commenting out the above code with a Feather M0 Proto. This is an expected value given the AP2112's regulator draw of ~50 uA and the 100/100 kOhm resistive voltage divider draw of ~20 uA. After replacing the AP2112 with a MIC5225 and slightly changing the voltage divider to 330/100 kOhm, I was able to reach ~26 uA. I love Adafruit products but they certainly do not emphasize low-power operation.


 - add ideal diode... n/a 

 transistor for voltage divider


 use transistors to disconnect
 - flash from power, or does enable pin handle this well? seems to depend on chip
 - voltage divider from power

 transistors to control
 - battery to display
 - voltage regulator to display


was the voltage actually the issue?
- thought power loss was from voltage being below 3.3v, but seems that its actually the voltage divider and flash chip drawing more than expected

- flashing on screen was a result of the polizarization flip
which does not seem to be a huge issue? can be disabled below certain vmon or only triggered during sleep states anyways


TODO:
- get dc power supply to test behavior at low voltage levels
- voltage cut off circuit? disconnect below 2v?
